## Files 
### [DBConnection](DBConnection.js) 
The Database Connection document connects to the Cosmos Database, and sets up the links to the tables for ease of use later. 

### [DBDevelopment](DBDevelopment.js)
This is the Dummy Database brought over from development. This is designed as a temporary patch, so future development should work instead using the [Database connection](DBConnection.js). 

### [Reply](Reply.js) 
The Reply Object is the common communicator for returning information to the client. This structures the information in a format that allows for easy validation and communication throughout this project. 
#### Inputs
Reply takes in 3 Possible Inputs: `data`, `point`, and `success`. 

##### `data`
Type: `Object`

Data is how anything of use is returned to the user. This acts as a kind of catchall for most returns. 

##### `point`
Type: `String`

Point is the place where the error was occurred at or which service succeeded. 

##### `success`
Type: `Boolean`

Success is whether the function succeeded, at this step or if this is a fail log.

#### Outputs
##### `data`
Type: `Object`

The same is the input.

##### `message`
Type: `String`

A condensed string for comprehension and/or user communication in the form of `[Succeeded or Failed] at [Point]`. 

##### `success`
Type: `Boolean`

Same as input, Boolean of success or failure. 

### [Helpers](Helpers.js)
General Helper Functions for use throughout other services or models 

#### [String Like](Helpers.js#strLike)
Parameters
- haystack (`String`)
- needle (`String`)

Searches the `haystack` for the `needle` and returns `true` if found. Also converts all to lowercase, so this is **not case sensitive**.
