## Running

Run `npm start` after initialized to start server on default port: `3000` 

After any change is made, the app will automatically update to show the change. 
- Note: The `console.log` will **not** automatically clear itself, so either clear it or look for new updates when debugging with it. 
- You can clear the console with `clear()`
